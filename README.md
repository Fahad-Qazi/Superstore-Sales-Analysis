Superstore Sales Analysis – Project Overview
In this project, I performed a comprehensive sales analysis of a superstore dataset, leveraging Python for data cleaning, analysis, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) before building an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights.

Key Steps & Methodology:
🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, formatted date columns, and corrected inconsistencies.
Created new KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) like Profit Margin, Shipping Time, and Discount Percentage.
🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python:

Analyzed sales trends across different years, categories, and regions.
Identified top-selling products, most profitable regions, and high-priority orders.
Examined the impact of discounts on profit margins and potential return patterns.
🔹 Power BI Dashboard & Insights:

Sales & Profit Analysis: Year-wise breakdown with drill-downs for deeper insights.
Top 5 Selling Products: Identified best-performing products.
Order & Shipping Trends: Evaluated order priority impact and shipping times.
Regional Sales Performance: Used map visualizations to track sales distribution across countries.
Category & Sub-category Breakdown: Sales contribution by product lines.
This project showcases my expertise in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and business intelligence to extract meaningful insights that drive data-driven decisions.
